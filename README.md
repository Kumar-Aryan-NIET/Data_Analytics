Data Science is 
- a multidisciplinary field 
  - that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. 
- It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields 
  - within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, and information science.

### Subdomains of Data Science:

1. Machine Learning: 
   - This involves creating and implementing algorithms 
     - that help machines receive data and use this data to make decisions without human intervention. [ Prediction]

2. Deep Learning: 
   - This is a subset of machine learning where algorithms are created and function similar to the human brain, called artificial neural networks.

3. Artificial Intelligence: 
   - a broader concept of machines, 
     - being able to carry out tasks in a way that we would consider “smart” or “intelligent”.

4. Predictive Analytics: 
   - This uses data, statistical algorithms, and machine learning techniques 
     - to identify the likelihood of future outcomes based on historical data.

5. Data Mining: 
   - This involves exploring and analyzing large amounts of data 
     - to discover patterns and other useful information.

6. Big Data: 
   - This refers to the vast volume of data     
     - that is beyond the ability of traditional databases to capture, store, manage, and analyze.
